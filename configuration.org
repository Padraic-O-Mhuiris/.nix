#+TITLE: Configuration


* Goals
Achieve modular OS system which can be readily deployed to a bare machine or vm with minimal manual setup. For physical machines there should be a specific layout with consideration to it's specific hardware setup. Also should provide solution to $HOME provisioning (all my local files/photos/music/etc). Another requirement is to enable setup of secrets and gpg keys easily

* Setup
This section lays out the steps to install the OS from scratch manually where a working implementation is installed

** Keyboard layout
Set to uk, permission required
#+begin_src
sudo loadkeys uk
#+end_src

** Connect to WiFi
#+begin_src
wpa_supplicant -B -i interface -c <(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'key')
#+end_src

More effective to create /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf which contains the requisite arguments. Then to connect all is required is ~sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant.service~.
