#+TITLE: Architecture


* Assumptions
This document aims to guide readers on how to install flake-based version of Nixos to a bare machine.
Requirements:
- wifi/ethernet connection
- a computer which will be totally overrided with a new OS
- USB stick x 2

* Installation
** Create a bootable NixOS live USB
** Jump to root shell
#+begin_src bash
sudo -i
#+end_src
** Connect wifi
** Set up ssh from local machine
With ssh access it is easier to develop installation script that will automate partition and other setups
